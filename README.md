# JustPutItOverThere

When making a trade-deal with a caravan, they will now try to place your bought items in storages instead of just dropping it on the ground.
If there are no available storage space that they can reach the items will be left on the ground as normal.
Also, if the caravan is currently leaving the map, items will be left on the ground.

Guests will also try to leave any gifts in storage if possible. This includes guests from https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=753498552]Hospitality as well.

Since modding is just a hobby for me I expect no donations to keep modding. If you still want to show your support you can gift me anything from my https://store.steampowered.com/wishlist/id/Mlie]Wishlist or buy me a cup of tea.
